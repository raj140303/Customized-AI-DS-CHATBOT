# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

# Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning â€“ learns from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning â€“ finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning â€“ learns from feedback via rewards and penalties

# What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of ML based on neural networks with multiple layers. It is especially powerful for image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

# Advantages of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Can perform zero-shot learning
- Understand natural language across many domains
- Capable of transfer learning and fine-tuning
- Automate tasks like summarization, translation, code generation

# Challenges in Training LLMs
- High financial cost
- Long training time
- Requires massive datasets
- High energy consumption (carbon footprint)

# Data Cleaning Techniques
- Handling missing values (e.g., fillna, dropna)
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing inconsistent formatting
- Detecting outliers

# Data Visualization Libraries
- Matplotlib: for static graphs like line plots, bar charts
- Seaborn: statistical plots (heatmaps, histograms)
- Plotly: interactive dashboards

# Useful Python Libraries in Data Science
- NumPy: numerical computing
- Pandas: data manipulation
- Scikit-learn: machine learning models
- TensorFlow / PyTorch: deep learning frameworks

# Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2 Score

# Real-World Use Cases of LLMs
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
- Automated content generation
- Code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Language translation and summarization
